I will be calling him very shortly for our next project as we are renovating room by room. He was able to give us a quote by sending him a picture. He stuck to his quote. We are very happy.',

He was always on time and worked efficiently and neatly. He did walls, ceilings, bulk heads, vaulted ceiling’s etc. We enjoyed having him on site and the work he did. He was hard working and professional and we will definitely hope to use him again in the future.',
