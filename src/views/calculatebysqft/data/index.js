      'Ulrik, did a fantastic job with the taping, mudding and sanding. He was constantly asking us to take a look at his job to make sure we were happy. He was quick and tidy. I will be calling him very shortly for our next project as we are renovating room by room. He was able to give us a quote by sending him a picture. He stuck to his quote. We are very happy.',

      'Ulrik was contracted to do taping and mudding for our entire house- 3 floors. He was able to answer questions all my questions and provided  us with a competitive quote. He was always on time and worked efficiently and neatly. He did walls, ceilings, bulk heads, vaulted ceilingâ€™s etc. We enjoyed having him on site and the work he did. He was hard working and professional and we will definitely hope to use him again in the future.',
