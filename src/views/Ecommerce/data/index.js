The tape's outer edge features a diamond punch pattern for a superior bond, faster drying, with no rippling or blistering. To apply, measure and cut to length, then fold in half at center crease with print side facing out. For repairing damaged corner bead, tap the damaged area of the corner bead to be recessed below the corner's edge. Apply all-purpose compound to corner. Press Mid-Flex 300 into the wet compound, adjust to create a straight line and wipe down with a taping knife using additional pressure to the outer edge of the tape. Immediately apply a light skim coat to the perforated edges and let dry. Apply final coat, let dry and sand.",

An extra strong gas cylinder provides 82lb of pressure – double the force of other pressurized compound tubes – enabling the use of thicker compounds and better flow, while still being easy to fill. The stainless steel ball end is compatible with the corner finishing attachments of most leading manufacturers. A spring loaded filler mechanism fits all pump filler nozzles. The MudShot’s unique push-to-release design means that MudShot handle extensions can be easily added to the handle base for reaching higher ceilings and walls.
